Welcome to the course, Before starting the course I want to give you small suggestion to watch this course in high definition:


 To watch the videos in high definition,When playing videos on udemy please make sure you click the HD button on your player.The
  HD button
 is located on right down of the player, when you move mouse cursor at the bottom of your player popup scroll will appear there you can see HD button, make sure clicked on it, Because it is not the default one I am mentioning it here.
